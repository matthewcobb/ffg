This third edition captured a very interesting period in VC, marking the completion of VC market’s full fundraising cycle. The first edition of the book was written during the linear growth curve of the post-2008 era. The second during the "bubble" in valuations formed post-COVID where we saw large injections of capital into private markets leading to an exponential growth period for startups. This third edition covers the collapse of that "bubble", and highlights common pitfalls you should avoid as an early-stage founder (such as taking too much money).

My hope is that as you embark on your fundraising journey, and no matter what stage you are at in the business cycle, you can lean on elements of this guide to help point you in the right direction and put yourself in a strong position to go into  investor discussions.
